# Sarcasm-Detection-in-News-Headlines-Using-NLP
This project uses NLP to detect sarcasm in news headlines. It leverages a clean dataset with sarcastic headlines from The Onion and real ones from HuffPost, avoiding the noise of Twitter data. Machine learning models are trained to classify whether a headline is sarcastic or not.
